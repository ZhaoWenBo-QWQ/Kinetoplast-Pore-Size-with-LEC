# Kinetoplast-Pore-Size-with-LEC

The purpose of this code is to calculate the radius and coordinates of the largest empty circle.
Here are its calculation steps:
1. Calculate all intersection points in the Voronoi diagram.
2. Calculate the convex hull of the given set of points.
3. Select Voronoi diagram intersection points located inside the conves hull.
4. Calculate radius and center coordinates of circle.
